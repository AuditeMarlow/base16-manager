Hello and thank you for your interest in `base16-manager`! :)

As `base16-manager` is a small, but growing project, it's a cool place to get
[started contributing to open source projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

Furthermore it's a great opportunity to improve your bash-scripting skills!
Wether it's the general structure or typical tools like `grep` or `sed`, you'll
get more familiar with it!

Last but not least, if you're an experienced bash programmer, we appreciate
your help on improving `base16-manager`'s structure.


Coding guidelines
-----------------

* Please write clean, organized and well documented code.
* Please make your code [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) compatible.
* If you're adding new templates, please try to use the existing functions
  wherever possible. Try to write new functions as generically as possible, so
  that they can be used to set other templates as well.


Tips for a good bug report
-------------------------

* Help us help you! The more details you give, the better we'll be able to
  help you out.
* Please use markdown syntax, especially for backtraces and config files!
* Sometimes even small and inconspicuous details matter, so please be very
  careful when writing down the steps to reproduce your problem.
* Please give us a list of program versions of **every** program relevant to
  your report.


Tips for writing a good feature request
---------------------------------------

* Describe your problem and especially the context of it very detailed.
* Please describe also your desired solution carefully.


Tips for writing good pull requests
-----------------------------------

* The first line should be a short (50 characters or less) summary of your
  commit message. If you can't find a short enough one-line summary, split the
  commit into multiple ones.
* Keep one line between the one-line summary and the body.
* Use bullet points in the body of the commit message to separate multiple
  things you did.
* Your commits should be clear and concise. That means also you shouldn't sum
  up two features or two bug fixes into one commit. If you do, it makes both
  bug fixes or features harder to understand. Also, don't hesitate to
  [rewrite](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) the
  Github history of your development branch.
* Wrap the body of the commit message at around 80 characters.
* If your commit addresses a particular PR, commit or Issue, please say so in
  your commit. The Github documentation
  ([1](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/)
  and [2](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/))
  can help you with that.


Thank you for your help!
